# 🎨 Tips and Tricks for Writing Good Image Prompts

Creating stunning AI-generated images goes beyond typing in a few words. With strategic prompting, you can drastically enhance the quality, realism, and artistic style of your images.

---

## A. 🧠 Be Specific  
The more detailed, the better. General prompts lead to generic outputs. Tell the AI *exactly* what you want.

**✅ Example:**  
`"A smiley monkey with dark glasses and a beer in hand pointing towards the camera"`

---

## B. ✨ Use Descriptive Words and Adjectives  
Enrich your prompt using **adjectives** to specify texture, color, mood, and other qualities.

**✅ Example:**  
`"A cozy wooden cabin, surrounded by snow-covered pine trees, glowing warmly from within"`

---

## C. 🖌️ Define the Style  
Specify a **visual style** or artistic influence (e.g., photorealism, anime, watercolor, Van Gogh, etc.).

**✅ Example:**  
`"A peaceful countryside scene with rolling hills and wildflowers, painted in the style of Van Gogh"`

---

## D. 🖼️ Set the Desired Quality  
Use terms like **“high-res”**, “4k”, “ultra-detailed”, or “minimalist” to control image quality and detail level.

**✅ Example:**  
`"Bustling Moroccan market with vibrant stalls, 4k resolution, warm tones, intricate patterns"`

---

## E. 📖 Add Context to the Scene  
Provide backstory or purpose to the image to help the AI place it in a meaningful setting.

**✅ Example:**  
`"Valiant knight in shining armor defending a castle at dusk, storm clouds overhead, heroic tone"`

---

## F. 📸 Use Photographic Terminology  
Photographic elements like **angle, lighting, depth** can guide the AI toward realism or a specific composition.

**✅ Examples:**  
- `"A close-up portrait with soft lighting, in the style of a Renaissance painting"`  
- `"A Viking warrior with dramatic side lighting, oil painting style"`

---

## G. 🌫️ Give It a Vibe  
Use mood-based words like “moody,” “ethereal,” “ominous,” “cheerful,” or “dreamlike” to shape the atmosphere.

**✅ Example:**  
`"A warrior in a dark, foreboding forest, with beams of eerie light piercing through the dense canopy"`

---

## H. 🧮 Reorder and Weight Prompts  
- **Put the most important elements first.**  
- Emphasize key terms using syntax like `((term))` or `::weight` depending on the platform (e.g., Midjourney or Stable Diffusion).

**✅ Examples:**  
- Reordered: `"Tropical beach at sunset, with palm trees and sparkling turquoise water"`  
- Weighted: `"A vintage car on a cobblestone street, ((beautiful sunset)), cityscape in the background"`

---

## ⚠️ Avoid Contradictions  
Don’t confuse the AI with mixed signals like:  
`"Close-up headshot of a full-body scene"`  
Stick to one focal perspective per prompt.

---

## 🧪 Final Tip: Experiment Often  
Don’t hesitate to rephrase, reweight, or reorder your prompt. Prompting is both an **art** and a **science**.

> 💡 *Prompting isn’t about giving instructions — it’s about painting pictures with words.*
